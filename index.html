              <h2>Competition Rules</h2>
              <p>By entering, you agree to accept these terms and conditions and warrant that you meet the entry
                requirements.</p>

              <h2>Registrants</h2>
              <p>Your contact information will be shared with team members. You can only be a member of one team.</p>

              <h2>Judging</h2>
              <p>The Hackathon competition judges will choose all winners. All submissions must be completed by the
                required time. No requests for extensions will be considered. To be eligible for prizes, submission of
                content must use the Email provided.
                Judges are not eligible to compete for prizes. All Hackathon entries will be judged by the Hackathon
                Competition Judging Panel against certain criteria. The criteria may include:
              <ul>
                <li>Originality.</li>
                <li>Relevance to the challenge.</li>
                <li>Quality and design.</li>
                <li>Usability.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <h2>Important Notice</h2>
              <p> To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be
                created during the Hackathon.<br>
                We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the
                true nature of a Hackathon.<br>
                However, you are free and encouraged to make plans, create wireframes and brainstorm prior to the
                event.<br>
                The only exception to this rule includes material that is freely available to the public.<br>
                You are encouraged to use 3rd party services, APIs, public domain images, creative commons music, open
                source projects, libraries and frameworks.<br>
                There is no need to break the rules, when there are so many great resources available to all
                Hackers.<br>
                We take these rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may
                result in the disqualification of the offending team.<br>
                If your team qualifies for prizes, you could be subject to a code review to verify that there was no
                foul play.</p>

              <h2>Winners and awards</h2>

                discretion applies to special circumstances. Each winning entrant must provide their details to the

            <h1>What The Hack?</h1>
            <p style="color: black;">TVH is an annual hacking competition that was introduced in 2018 by its Chief Organizer Mr Mash Phurutsi.
              TVH is a Tshwane University of Technology hackathon competition organized by the Faculty of ICT &
              Directorate of Research & Innovation in partnership with the industry in support of, the National
              Development Plan (Vision 2030) of the Government of the Republic of South Africa by addressing Chapter 9
              of the plan that focuses on “Improving Education, Training and Innovation”. TVH is further aligned to TUT
              2020 – 2025 strategic positioning on the ambitions to become a digitally-advanced university.<br><br>
              TVH is gradually becoming an innovation movement as it has grown from a small event to include all
              universities in the City of Tshwane (UP, SMU & UNISA) and is running throughout the year with empowerment
              workshops to close the agile system development and Cloud Computing knowledge gap between the industry and
              the university community.<br><br>
              The TVH will use a hackathon format, underpinned by Agile Scrum and AWS Cloud Computing practices, to
              deliver fresh ideas and solutions that catalyzes 4IR in the African continent. </p>

            <h1>How the Hack</h1>
            <p style="color: black;">Partners from the industry, municipality (City of Tshwane), and Universities will be requested to present
              challenges that are currently faced by global citizens. Applicants will then be required to come up with
              innovative solutions to solve these problems.</p>
            <p style="color: black;">
              Groups consisting of 7-10 participants will be formed by the members of the organizing team. In each
              group, there has to be a student hacker with the following background/knowledge:
            </p>

            <p >
            <ul style="color: black;">
              <li>Programmers and Engineers</li>
              <li>Marketing and entrepreneurship </li>
              <li>Design (UI/UX) </li>
              <li>First year students </li>
              <li>Girl-Coder</li>
              <li>SCRUM Masters</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p style="color: black;">
              ICT and engineering hackers will demonstrate their skills in software development, cloud computing, agile
              practices to develop digital solutions that can solve presented challenges.<br><br>
              Applicants will only be given 53 hours to do all of this. This competition, therefore, assists with the
              growth of student’s problem-solving skills, in so doing, contributing to producing future-ready graduates.
